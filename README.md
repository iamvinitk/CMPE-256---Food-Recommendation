# CMPE-256 Food Recommendation System


The data needed for the Python Notebooks can be found at https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#foodcom
</br>
Since dataset is huge, it is not uploaded here. Need to be kept in a
folder data for the code to run.
</br>
Given a personâ€™s preferences in past recipes, can we predict other new recipes they might enjoy?
